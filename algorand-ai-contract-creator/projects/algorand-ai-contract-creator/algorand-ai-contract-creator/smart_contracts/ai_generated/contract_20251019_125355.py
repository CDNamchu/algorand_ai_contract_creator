# PyTeal Voting Contract with Token Locking
# =============================================
# Purpose: Users lock tokens (ASA) to vote on proposals, with a 7-day deadline.
#          After deadline, votes are tallied and tokens are unlocked.
#          Only one vote per user per proposal is allowed.
# =============================================

GLOBAL_LOCKED_ASA = Bytes("locked_asa")    # ASA ID that must be locked to vote

# Local state keys (per user)
LOCAL_HAS_VOTED = Bytes("has_voted")       # Has this user voted on current proposal?

## Contract Purpose Summary

This PyTeal smart contract enables token-weighted voting on proposals: users must lock a specified ASA (Algorand Standard Asset) to participate, and can vote only once per proposal. Voting is open for a set duration (e.g., 7 days), after which users may withdraw their locked tokens. The contract enforces strict access control, prevents double voting, and securely manages asset locking/unlocking.

## Logic Walkthrough

- **On Creation:** Initializes global state (proposal ID, deadline, vote total, ASA ID).
- **Proposal Setup:** Only the creator can set the ASA to lock and the voting deadline (in rounds). Resets vote totals and increments proposal ID.
- **Opt-In:** Users must opt-in to store local state (has_voted, locked_amount).
- **Vote:** Users submit a grouped transaction: an app call and an ASA transfer to the contract. The contract checks the ASA, amount, sender, deadline, and that the user hasn’t already voted. It then records the vote and locks the tokens.
- **Unlock:** After the deadline, users can withdraw their locked ASA via a grouped transaction. The contract verifies the correct ASA, amount, and that the user previously voted.
- **Clear State:** If a user clears their state, they forfeit locked tokens (security measure to prevent state manipulation).

## Security Considerations

- **No Hardcoded Addresses/Keys:** All addresses and assets are dynamic.
- **No Unbounded Loops:** All logic is branch-based, no loops.
- **No Reentrancy:** Each operation is atomic; no callbacks or external calls.
- **No Unsafe Global State:** Only the creator can set critical globals; users interact via local state.
- **Integer Safety:** All arithmetic is checked by the AVM; no manual overflow risk.

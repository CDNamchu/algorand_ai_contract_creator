**Contract Purpose Summary:**

This PyTeal smart signature implements a **2-of-3 multisignature escrow wallet** on Algorand. The multisig logic (requiring signatures from at least two of three owners) is enforced off-chain by combining signatures into a multisig LogicSig account. The contract ensures only valid payment transactions with safe fee, no rekeying, no close remainder, and single transaction submission are allowed, securing the funds under multisig control.

---

**Logic Walkthrough:**

- **Transaction type check:** Only payment transactions are allowed.
- **Fee check:** Transaction fee must be ≤ 1000 microAlgos and flat fee must be set.
- **No rekeying:** Prevents changing the escrow account’s authorized signer.
- **No close remainder:** Prevents funds from being closed out to arbitrary accounts.
- **Single transaction:** Ensures no grouped transactions to avoid complex exploits.
- **Multisig enforcement:** The actual 2-of-3 signature aggregation happens off-chain; this contract assumes the multisig LogicSig address is created with threshold 2 and owners’ addresses.

---

**Security Considerations:**

- **Off-chain multisig aggregation:** Algorand multisig wallets are created off-chain by combining public keys and threshold. This contract is the escrow logic for that multisig address.
- **No rekeying or close remainder:** Prevents unauthorized fund diversion.
- **Flat fee enforcement:** Avoids fee manipulation attacks.
- **No grouped transactions:** Simplifies logic and reduces attack surface.
- **No hardcoded addresses in contract:** Owner addresses are parameters at compile time; replace placeholders with actual addresses securely.
- **No loops or complex state:** This is a stateless smart signature, minimizing risk.
- **Use TEAL version 5 or higher:** Ensures compatibility with latest features and security fixes.

---

**Deployment Parameters Needed:**

- Replace `"OWNER1ADDRESSXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"`, `"OWNER2ADDRESSXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"`, and `"OWNER3ADDRESSXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"` with the actual Algorand addresses of the three owners.
- Create the multisig LogicSig account off-chain with threshold 2 and these three owners.
- Compile and deploy this PyTeal smart signature as the LogicSig program for the multisig escrow account.
- Fund the multisig escrow account with Algos.
- Owners sign transactions off-chain and combine signatures to authorize spending from the multisig escrow.

This approach follows Algorand best practices for multisig wallets by leveraging off-chain multisig signature aggregation and on-chain transaction validation via a secure PyTeal smart signature escrow.
